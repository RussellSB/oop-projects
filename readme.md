# Assignments Repository
In this repository, you'll find all the base code for each assignment as they become available. In order to get the code from this repository, you will have to have added this repository as a remote in your local git repository. For more information about how to do this, please consult `getting_started.md` in your own repository.

Because of how CircleCi works, when it is time to move on to a new assignment, this repository's CircleCi configuration is updated so that only that new assignment will be built and tested. Therefore, if you are late with an assignment, please finish it and get your pull request approved before pulling updates from this repository onto your `development` branch.

There may be issues with CircleCi, Github, or other unforeseen circumstances, so it can be useful to check back here occaisionally in case it is advised that you pull new updates from this repository.
